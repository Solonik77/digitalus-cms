= Introduction =
*_Version 1.10 is currently being developed in SVN_*

In version 1.10 of the Digitalus CMS there have been some significant changes in the database structure, especially regarding the database _user_.
This requires an update of the databases.

= Significant changes and new features =
To clean up the directory structure, the _data_ and _configs_ directories have been moved into the _admin_ module directory.

The _language_ directory has been renamed to _languages_ with a trailing _s_. This also affects the modules. Modules' translation files have to reside in a directory called _languages_.

Please adjust the language path in Your config.xml as follows:
{{{
<language>
    <path>./application/admin/data/languages</path>
    ...
</language>
}}}

In version 1.10 some changes to the model _user_ have been made. It is now possible (and required) to define a username for each user. In a first step, the email address is copied to use as username.
Users can now be (de)activated.
This comes along with a registration module to register new users via the frontend.

In modules until v1.10 it was only possible to assign a frontend action (PublicController) to a page. Now it's possible to define the action name via a url parameter. Simply add _/p/a/ACTIONNAME_ to the url and the action _ACTIONNAME_ will be performed.
