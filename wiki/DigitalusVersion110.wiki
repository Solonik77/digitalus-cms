#labels Phase-Deploy
= Introduction =
In version 1.10 of the Digitalus CMS there have been some significant changes in the database structure, especially regarding the database _user_.
This requires an update of the databases.

= New Features =
In version 1.10 some changes to the model _user_ have been made. It is now possible (and required) to define a username for each user.
Users can now be (de)activated.
This comes  along with a registration module to register new users via the frontend.

In modules until v1.10 it was only possible to assign a frontend action (PublicController) to a page. Now, it's possible to define the action Name via a url parameter. Simply add _/p/a/ACTIONNAME_ to the url and the action ACTIONNAME will be performed.
